# About Parliament-project
Parliament-project is my first school project using Kotlin. Idea of of the application is that user can see all members of Finnish parliament and view some details of them. Data is fetched from json file that is hosted online. Application also works offline since it is loading all the data from json to room database and uses existing data if there is no connection to network. For images we use Glide library, web request we handle with Retrofit and json support is handled by Moshi.
